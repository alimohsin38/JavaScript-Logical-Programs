This tutorial will help you for making the JavaScript logical programs.

This will give you examples for the logical programs.
This will help you develop your own logics and tricks to complete the JavaScript tasks rapidly.
You can also write your questions related to any JavaScript task. I'll try to do and give you the instant solution of that problem.
You can see the output of all the JavaScript programs in console window of your browser.
